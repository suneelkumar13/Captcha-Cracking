# CAPTCHA Breaking Series

This repository focuses on different methods of breaking CAPTCHA.  A series of Jupyter Notebooks will be updated in this respository to underline the different methods both for breaking CAPTCHA, and the different types of CAPTCHAs found in the wild.  The ultimate goal is to make a multi-dimensional CAPTCHA breaker which will be used in the smart spider, Ambly.

## Getting Started

Recommended that you download the Jupyter Notebook and host it in a Google Collab environment, or a virtual Jupyter Notebook environment on a local host.  AWS also offers hosting for those with access.

### Prerequisites
Most of what you'll need is already set to install in the code-blocks of the notebook.  You will need to gather samples for the CAPTCHA breaker.  What CAPTCHA samples are needed will change depending on the stage/notebook.

For stage one, "CAPTCH_Breaking_Part_1.ipynb", follow this link and download the folder "Captcha Samples":

### Updates
